# AMMonitorFU
Hello FU Members!

Welcome to GitHub! GitHub allows our community to effciently add to, adjust, or change the code we have created on the AMMonitor at the comfort of your own laptop!

The branch "main" is (as the name says) our UPDATED main code/file

The branch "FIXES" is where one can change our main code without permantently changing it. Essentially, you can play around with our main code without the fear of accidentally ruining "main". After you have "committed" (saved) your code in "FIXES" you can add your code created in "FIXES" to "main" by clicking "pull requests". "Pull requests" allows other collabators to look at your new code or you can just merge the code into "main" yourself!

Hope this mini explanation helps you get started on Github!
